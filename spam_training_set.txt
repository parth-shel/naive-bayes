lab 1 clarifications
Hello everyone!
To make a few clarifications about the specifications of lab 1 and the dynamic resizing of the ArrayList implementation, 
1. The ArrayList structure you implement should double in capacity when it is full, to amortize insertion operations. So if the list is full and you try to add an element, it should double in size.
2. The ArrayList should shrink in capacity i.e. the underlying array structure should reduce to half it's size when it is one-quarter full, to avoid thrashing.
3. The ArrayList should allow the user to add elements in the middle, thus causing interpolation. Remember that this is NOT a sparse array implementation and so add queries to indices larger than it's size should fail. 
4. The user should be able to remove elements at valid indices and the list should shrink such that there are no holes or gaps in the structure.
5. push and pop operations on the ArrayList should have an amortized cost of O(1) and insertion and removal operations on random indices should have a complexity of O(n). The ArrayList should have an amortized memory usage of O(n) for storing N elements.
If you have any other questions about the lab, talk to your PSO instructor or visit TA help sessions that are posted on the course webpage or post on Piazza.

P S. (P@purdue.edu)

lab 2 released
Hello everybody,
The lab 2 handout has been released on the course webpage and you can download the tarball and scp it to the CS remote servers and start working on it. This lab will be due next week on Thursday, June 28th by 11:59 pm.
In this lab, you will implement an expression evaluator using stacks.
Notes:
1. You can assume that the expression given to you is valid and has balanced brackets.
2. The inputs to all the trigonometric functions are in degrees and not in radians. The logarithm is to the base 10.
3. You cannot the STL stack implementation. You will have to implement a generic stack using templates.

P S. (P@purdue.edu)
